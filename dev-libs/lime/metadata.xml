    LIME is an end-to-end encryption library for one-to-one and group
    instant messaging, allowing users to exchange messages privately
    and asynchronously. It uses modern ciphering curve X448 and double
    ratchet algorithm for perfect forward secrecy.
    LIME is composed of a portable client library coupled with
    a public key server developed by Belledonne Communications to
    allow end-to-end encryption for messaging, without having to
    exchange cryptographic keys simultaneously.
    The library exposes a C, C++, Python and Java API for easy integration
    in mobile and desktop environments.
    LIME supports multiple devices per user and multiple users per device.

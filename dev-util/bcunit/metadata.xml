    BCUnit is a fork of the defunct project CUnit with several fixes and patches
    applied.
    CUnit is a Unit testing framework for C. The basic framework is
    platform/version independent and should be portable to all platforms.
    CUnit provides various interfaces to the framework, some of which are
    platform dependent (e.g. curses on *nix). Building other interfaces should
    be straightforward with the facilities provided in the framework.

    These are public type stubs for pandas, following the convention of
    providing stubs in a separate package, as specified in PEP 561.
    The stubs cover the most typical use cases of pandas. In general,
    these stubs are narrower than what is possibly allowed by pandas,
    but follow a convention of suggesting best recommended practices
    for using pandas.

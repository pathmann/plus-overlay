    Originally, SOCI was developed by Maciej Sobczak at CERN as abstraction
    layer for Oracle, a Simple Oracle Call Interface. Later, several database
    backends have been developed for SOCI, thus the long name has lost its
    practicality. Currently, if you like, SOCI may stand for
    Simple Open (Database) Call Interface or something similar.

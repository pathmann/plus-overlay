    CodeSynthesis XSD is an open-source, cross-platform W3C XML Schema
    to C++ data binding compiler. Provided with an XML instance
    specification (XML Schema), it generates C++ classes that represent
    the given vocabulary as well as XML parsing and serialization code.
    You can then access the data stored in XML using types and functions
    that semantically correspond to your application domain rather than
    dealing with the intricacies of reading and writing XML.

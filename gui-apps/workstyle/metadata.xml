  Workspaces with style! This program will dynamically rename your workspaces
  to indicate which programs are running in each workspace. It uses the i3 ipc
  protocol, which makes it compatible with sway and i3. By default, each
  program is mapped to a unicode character for concision. The short description
  of each program is configurable. In the absence of a config file, one will be
  generated automatically. See \${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/workstyle/config.yml for
  details.
